['Fig. 1. These plots show the coefﬁcient estimate and 95% conﬁdence interval over the range of SPI6 (A) and TI6 (B) for the model in Table 1, column f.', 'Nonoverlap between the conﬁdence interval and dashed zero line indicates a statistically signiﬁcant effect. The lower dark gray plots show the density dis-', 'tributions of the variable—both SPI6 and TI6 are centered right of zero, indicating that our study period is wetter and warmer than the 60-y comparison period.']
