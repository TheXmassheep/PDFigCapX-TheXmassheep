['Figure 4. Simulation: performance comparison.', 'Note: The figures shows the performances of PRIOGRID assignment (yellow dot-long-dashed line), district assignment (gray long-', 'dashed line), a convex hull (purple dot-dashed line), support vector machine (blue dotted line), maximum entropy method (green', 'dashed line), and OCSVM (red solid line). The upper and lower panes show the results when the territories of Nigeria and Somalia', 'are used in the simulation respectively. The horizontal axis shows the level of noise in the observed data (Ïƒ). The vertical axis', 'shows the accuracy. The confidence intervals are very small and hence not reported.']
